    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Miketyson the greatest of all time, it is an honor to creare a website about him.
        A member of various street gangs at an early age,
        Tyson was sent to reform school in upstate New York in 1978.
        At the reform school, social worker and boxing aficionado Bobby
        Stewart recognized his boxing potential and directed him to renowned 
        trainer Cus D'Amato, who became his legal guardian. Tyson compiled a 24-3 
        record as an amateur and turned professional in 1985.</p>
    <p>
        D'Amato taught Tyson a peekaboo boxing style, with hands held close to his cheeks and a continuous bobbing motion
        in the boxing ring that made his defense almost impenetrable. At 5 feet 11 inches (1.8 metres) tall and weighing 
        about 218 pounds (99 kg), Tyson was short and squat and lacked the classic heavyweight boxer's appearance, 
        but his surprising quickness and aggressiveness in the ring overwhelmed most of his opponents. 
        On November 22, 1986, he became the youngest heavyweight champion in history, with a second-round knockout
        of Trevor Berbick, to claim the crown of the World Boxing Council (WBC). On March 7, 1987, he acquired the 
        World Boxing Association (WBA) belt when he defeated James Smith. After he defeated Tony Tucker
        on August 1, 1987, Tyson was unanimously recognized as champion by all three sanctioning organizations
        (WBC, WBA, and International Boxing Federation [IBF]).
    </p>
        
    <p>
        After the deaths of D'Amato and manager Jimmy Jacobs,
        Tyson aligned with controversial promoter Don King. He made 10 successful defenses of his world 
        heavyweight title, including victories over former champions Larry Holmes and Michael Spinks. 
        In 1988 Tyson married actress Robin Givens, but the couple divorced in 1989 amid allegations that 
        Tyson had physically abused her. A myriad of assault and harassment charges were subsequently filed against Tyson.

        On February 11, 1990, in one of the biggest upsets in boxing history, Tyson lost the championship 
        to lightly regarded James (“Buster”) Douglas, who scored a technical knockout in the 10th round.
        Tyson rebounded from the loss with four straight victories. In 1991, however, he was accused of
        having raped a beauty pageant contestant, and he was convicted of the charge in 1992.
